**Theory of Operation**

The custom functions subsystem is meant for implementing custom and application-specific logic.
The CFS provides up to 64 32-bit memory-mapped read/write
registers (`REG`, see register map below) that can be accessed by the CPU via normal load/store operations.
The actual functionality of these register has to be defined by the hardware designer. Furthermore, the CFS
provides two IO conduits to implement custom on-chip or off-chip interfaces.

In contrast to connecting custom hardware accelerators via external memory interfaces (like SPI or the processor's
external bus interface), the CFS provide a convenient, low-latency and tightly-coupled extension and
customization option.

Just like any other externally-connected IP, logic implemented within the custom functions subsystem can operate
_independently_ of the CPU providing true parallel processing capabilities. Potential use cases might include
dedicated hardware accelerators for en-/decryption (AES), signal processing (FFT) or AI applications
(CNNs) as well as custom IO systems like fast memory interfaces (DDR) and mass storage (SDIO), networking (CAN)
or real-time data transport (I2S).

[TIP]
If you like to implement _custom instructions_ that are executed right within the CPU's ALU
see the <<_zxcfu_custom_instructions_extension_cfu>> and the according <<_custom_functions_unit_cfu>>.

[TIP]
Take a look at the template CFS VHDL source file (`rtl/core/neorv32_cfs.vhd`). The file is highly
commented to illustrate all aspects that are relevant for implementing custom CFS-based co-processor designs.

[TIP]
The CFS can also be used to _replicate_ existing NEORV32 modules - for example to implement several TWI controllers.


**CFS Software Access**

The CFS memory-mapped registers can be accessed by software using the provided C-language aliases (see
register map table below). Note that all interface registers are declared as 32-bit words of type `uint32_t`.

.CFS Software Access Example
[source,c]
----
// C-code CFS usage example
NEORV32_CFS.REG[0] = (uint32_t)some_data_array(i); // write to CFS register 0
int temp = (int)NEORV32_CFS.REG[20]; // read from CFS register 20
----

[TIP]
A very simple example program that uses the _default_ CFS hardware module can be found in `sw/example/cfs_demo`.


**CFS Interrupt**

The CFS provides a single high-level-triggered interrupt request signal mapped to the CPU's fast interrupt channel 1.
Once triggered, the interrupt becomes pending (if enabled in the `mis` CSR) and has to be explicitly cleared again by
writing zero to the according <<_mip>> CSR bit. See section <<_processor_interrupts>> for more information.


**CFS Configuration Generic**

By default, the CFS provides a single 32-bit `std_(u)logic_vector` configuration generic _IO_CFS_CONFIG_
that is available in the processor's top entity. This generic can be used to pass custom configuration options
from the top entity directly down to the CFS. The actual definition of the generic and it's usage inside the
CFS is left to the hardware designer.


**CFS Custom IOs**

By default, the CFS also provides two unidirectional input and output conduits `cfs_in_i` and `cfs_out_o`.
These signals are directly propagated to the processor's top entity. These conduits can be used to implement
application-specific interfaces like memory or peripheral connections. The actual use case of these signals
has to be defined by the hardware designer.

The size of the input signal conduit `cfs_in_i` is defined via the top's _IO_CFS_IN_SIZE_ configuration
generic (default = 32-bit). The size of the output signal conduit `cfs_out_o` is defined via the top's
_IO_CFS_OUT_SIZE_ configuration generic (default = 32-bit). If the custom function subsystem is not implemented
(_IO_CFS_EN_ = false) the `cfs_out_o` signal is tied to all-zero.
